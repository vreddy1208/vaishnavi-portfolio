    <h3>About</h3>

    <div class="about-card">
      <p>
        I’m a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, with a strong interest in
        frontend development and UI design. I enjoy translating ideas into clean, usable interfaces that feel intuitive
        rather than complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        My frontend work focuses on structure, spacing, and interaction clarity. I break designs into logical components
        and build responsive layouts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, paying close attention to usability across
        devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside UI development, my academic exposure to machine learning helps me understand how interfaces support
        data, user inputs, and results. This allows me to design frontend experiences that align well with data-driven
        workflows.
